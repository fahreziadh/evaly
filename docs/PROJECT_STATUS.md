### üöß Partially Implemented

#### Question Bank Management
- **Current State**: UI exists but shows placeholder data
- **Files**: `/app/questions/` routes
- **Issues**: 
  - Not connected to real backend data
  - Template creation page returns placeholder
  - Question details page needs completion

#### Test Results & Analytics
- **Current State**: Basic structure exists
- **Missing**: 
  - Grading logic
  - Score calculation
  - Performance analytics
  - Export functionality

### ‚ùå Not Implemented

#### Critical Features
1. **Simplified Participant Experience**:
   - Direct link sharing (WhatsApp, email, etc.)
   - Guest access without account creation
   - Pre-registration with auto-invitations
   - Bulk participant import via CSV
   - Invitation tracking and management

2. **Live Test Mode**: Real-time synchronized testing
3. **Email Notifications**: Invitations, results, reminders
4. **Test Scheduling**: Time-based availability
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed performance reports
6. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export questions
7. **AI Question Generation**: Despite UI buttons existing

#### Infrastructure
1. **Test Coverage**: No tests written
2. **Error Pages**: No 404 or error boundaries
3. **Monitoring**: No error tracking setup
4. **Documentation**: No user guides

## Technical Debt

### High Priority Issues
1. **Question Management Pages**: Currently showing hardcoded data
2. **Type Safety**: Some unsafe type assertions
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error messages
4. **Performance**: No pagination for large datasets

### Code Quality Issues
- Missing client-side validation in some forms
- Inconsistent component patterns
- No loading states in some areas
- Limited mobile responsiveness

## Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Convex Backend
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
CONVEX_SITE_URL=

# Authentication
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# File Storage (R2)
R2_BUCKET_NAME=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

### Deployment Configuration
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Frontend Build**: Vinxi (TanStack Start)
- **Backend**: Convex Cloud
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Target**: AWS Lambda with streaming

## Security Considerations

### Current Security
- OAuth authentication
- Ownership verification
- Input validation on mutations

### Missing Security Features
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy
- File upload validation
- Session timeout management

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Entities
- `users`: User accounts
- `organization`: Multi-tenant support
- `organizer`: Organizer profiles
- `test`: Test definitions
- `testSection`: Test structure
- `question`: Question bank
- `testAttempt`: Participant attempts
- `testAttemptAnswer`: Submitted answers
- `testPresence`: Real-time tracking

## API Endpoints Status

### Working Endpoints (Convex Functions)
- ‚úÖ Authentication flows
- ‚úÖ Test CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Question management
- ‚úÖ Test attempt tracking
- ‚úÖ File uploads

### Incomplete Endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Results calculation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics aggregation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bulk operations

## Performance Metrics

### Current Issues
- No pagination (loads all data)
- No caching strategy
- Large bundle size (needs code splitting)
- No lazy loading for routes

### Recommendations
1. Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
2. Add React Query caching
3. Code split by route
4. Optimize image loading

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on: Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- Mobile: Partial support (needs responsive improvements)
- Minimum requirements: ES2020 support

## Known Bugs

1. **Question Template Page**: Returns "Hello" instead of actual content
2. **Question List**: Shows hardcoded placeholder data
3. **AI Generation Buttons**: Non-functional despite being in UI
4. **Mobile Navigation**: Some dropdowns don't work on mobile
5. **File Upload**: No file type validation

## Development Setup Issues

### Common Problems
1. Convex dev server must run alongside Vinxi
2. Environment variables must be set before running
3. Bun required (not Node.js)
4. TypeScript strict mode may show errors

## Next Steps Priority (Phase-based Releases)

### Phase 1: Alpha Release (1-2 weeks)
**Target**: 5-10 internal testers
1. Fix question management pages (critical)
2. Implement basic results display
3. Add error handling and 404 pages
4. Basic deployment setup

### Phase 2: Beta Release (2-3 weeks after Alpha)
**Target**: 50-100 users (small classrooms)
1. **Implement simplified participant experience**:
   - Direct link sharing capability
   - Guest access without login
   - Pre-registration with auto-invites
   - Participant management dashboard
2. Add email notifications system
3. Implement test scheduling
4. Fix mobile responsiveness

### Phase 3: Public Release (3-4 weeks after Beta)
**Target**: 500-1000 users
1. Performance optimizations (pagination, caching)
2. Live test mode implementation
3. Import/export functionality
4. Security hardening

### Phase 4: Growth Release (4-6 weeks after Public)
