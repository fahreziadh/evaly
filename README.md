- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.0.0 or higher (for Convex CLI)
- [Convex](https://convex.dev/) account for backend services

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fahreziadh/evaly.git
cd evaly

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

**Local Environment:**
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Convex deployment info:

```bash
# Convex deployment (from your Convex dashboard)
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-convex-deployment-name
```

**Convex Environment Variables:**
Set these in your Convex dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
# Set via Convex CLI
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID your-google-client-id
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET your-google-client-secret
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000

# For file uploads (Cloudflare R2)
npx convex env set R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID your-r2-access-key
npx convex env set R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY your-r2-secret-key
npx convex env set R2_BUCKET your-bucket-name
npx convex env set R2_ENDPOINT your-r2-endpoint
npx convex env set R2_CDN_URL your-cdn-url
npx convex env set R2_TOKEN your-r2-token

# JWT config (auto-generated by Convex Auth)
npx convex env set JWKS your-jwks-json
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY your-jwt-private-key
```

Alternatively, set these through the [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under Settings → Environment Variables.

### 3. Start Development Servers

You'll need two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Convex Backend:**
```bash
npx convex dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Development Server:**
```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
