# Evaly - Development Roadmap

## Release Strategy
Each phase represents a deployable release that provides value to users, even if not feature-complete. We'll gather feedback and iterate with each release.

## üì± Participant Experience Strategy

### Two Ways to Join Tests

#### 1. **Direct Link Sharing**
- Organizer shares test link via any channel (WhatsApp, email, Slack, etc.)
- Participant clicks link ‚Üí enters name/email ‚Üí starts test
- No account creation required
- Works on any device with a browser

#### 2. **Pre-registration with Auto-Invites**
- Organizer adds participants to test (email list or CSV import)
- **Two invitation scenarios**:
  - **Added before publish**: All participants receive invite email when test is published
  - **Added after publish**: Participant receives invite email immediately upon being added
- Email contains personalized link with one-click access
- System tracks invitation status and allows resending

### Benefits of This Approach
- **Flexibility**: Teachers can use their preferred communication method
- **Simplicity**: No complex onboarding for participants  
- **Tracking**: Organizers can see who joined and who didn't
- **Accessibility**: Works for both tech-savvy and non-technical users
